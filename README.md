# Homework-1

The Horiseon website was originally put together and did not follow the basic rules for Americans with Disabilities Act, which is a requirement companies need to follow for people that fall in that category of disabilities. I personally went back to the code writtten out originally and changed certain things so it can meet the requirements, without changing how the original website looked.

When I went into the html code for the website I changed certain divs using semantic html elements. By doing this it made the program much easier to read and met the guidelines being asked. I gave section, article, header, and a few more tags to replace the original div tags.

After making the necessary changes to the html code, I moved onto the CSS part to make certain parts more condensed and simple. I did this by removing certain image sections which were being repeated, when it could have just been under one section such as "marketing-management". After doing that I scrolled down and noticed the same thing again with the background color, font-family, and color sections, so i deleted two of the sections and renamed the first one to ".marketing-management".

Throughout this entire process I received helped from my fellow colleagues and instructors as well. They looked over my work and guided me through certain points where I got stuck.
